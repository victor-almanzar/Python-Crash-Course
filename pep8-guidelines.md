The PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code offers comprehensive guidelines for writing readable, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing code in Python. Here's a condensed version of the guide in bullet points:

### Code Layout
- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- **Line Length:** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code and 72 for comments.
- **Blank Lines:** Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and within functions to indicate logical sections.
- **Imports:** Should be on separate lines and grouped in the following order: standard library imports, related third party imports, local application/library specific imports. You should put a blank line between each group.
- **Whitespace:** Use whitespace in expressions and statements as specified (e.g., no extra spaces inside parentheses, brackets, braces; a space around operators).
- **Comments:** Keep comments up-to-date when the code changes; comments should be complete sentences. If a comment is a phrase or sentence, its first word should be capitalized, unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter the case of identifiers!).
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive naming styles for different types (e.g., `CamelCase` for classes, `lowercase_with_underscores` for functions and variables).
- **Encoding:** Code in the core Python distribution should always use UTF-8, and files should not have an encoding declaration if they use ASCII-only.

### String Quotes
- In Python, single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same. PEP 8 does not recommend one over the other; consistency is key.

### Whitespace in Expressions and Statements
- Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
  - Immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.
  - Between a trailing comma and a following close parenthesis.
  - Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon.
  - However, in slicing, a space is used after the colon for readability.

### When to Use Trailing Commas
- Use trailing commas in sequences of items when they are multiline to simplify adding or removing items.

### Comments
- Comments should contrast with the code to clarify and not confuse.
- Block comments apply to the code that follows and should be indented to the same level.
- Inline comments should be used sparingly and should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.

### Documentation Strings
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods. Docstrings should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
- The docstring should be a phrase ending in a period if the method is simple and its operation is obvious.

### Version Bookkeeping
- If you have to have Subversion, CVS, or RCS crud in your source file, do it as follows.

### Naming Conventions
- Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.
- Never use characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
- Package and Module Names: Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.
- Class Names: Use the CapWords convention.
- Function Names: Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
- Variable Names: Use the same convention as function names.
- Constants: Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.

### Programming Recommendations
- Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with `is` or `is not`, never the equality operators.
- Use `is not` operator rather than `not ... is`. While both expressions are functionally identical, the former is more readable and preferred.
- When implementing order comparisons, use the `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` operators instead of the `==` and `!=` operators. There is a subtlety when the operands are of different types.
- Use `.startswith()` and `.endswith()` instead of slicing for checking prefixes or suffixes.
- Object type comparisons should always use `isinstance()` instead of comparing types directly.
- For sequences, (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences are false.

PEP 8 is about consistency and readability in the Python community. Following these guidelines helps maintain code quality and developer collaboration.
